# Household-Size-prediction
Introduction
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can estimate
the average household size based on geographical factors such as state
and county. The project will involve data preprocessing, model training,
evaluation, and visualization.
Objectives
- Explore and understand the dataset: Analyze the provided dataset,
identify relevant features, and gain insights into the average household size
variations.
- Data preprocessing: Handle missing values, perform feature scaling, and
split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Model selection and training: Implement three regression models - Lasso
Regression, OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) Linear Regression, and
Support Vector Regression (SVR). Train the models using the training
dataset.
- Model evaluation: Assess the performance of each model using
evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error, Root Mean Squared Error,
Mean Absolute Error, and R-squared.
- Visualize the results: Create scatter plots to compare the predicted values
against the actual values for each regression model. Additionally, plot the
best fit line to visualize the relationship between the actual and predicted
values.
Methodology
The project will be divided into the following stages:
1. Data Preprocessing
- Load the dataset using Pandas.
- Handle missing values by replacing them with the mean of the
respective column.
- Split the dataset into features (X) and the target variable (y).
2. Model Training and Evaluation:
- Split the data into training and testing sets using the train_test_split
function.
- Implement three regression models: Lasso Regression, OLS Linear
Regression, and SVR.
- Train each model using the training dataset.
- Evaluate the models' performance using Mean Squared Error, Root
Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Error, and R-squared.
Visualization:
- Create scatter plots to compare the predicted values against the actual
values for each regression model.
- Plot the best fit line to visualize the relationship between the actual and
predicted values.
Tools and Technologies
The project will be implemented using the following tools and technologies:
- Python: The code will be written in Python programming language.
- Jupyter Notebook: Jupyter Notebook will be used for code development
and execution.
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, and Matplotlib will be utilized for
data manipulation, modeling, evaluation, and visualization.

3. M. Hassan Nasir (CS201206)
Expected Outcomes
The expected outcomes of this project include:
- Trained regression models: Lasso Regression, OLS Linear Regression,
and SVR.
- Evaluation metrics: Mean Squared Error, Root Mean Squared Error, Mean
Absolute Error, and R-squared for each model.
- Scatter plots comparing the predicted values against the actual values for
each model.
- Best fit lines showing the relationship between the actual and predicted
values.
Conclusion
By completing this project, we will have developed regression models to
predict average household size
